# 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This project is an implementation of a research paper focused on detecting **Alzheimer's disease** using deep learning techniques. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify brain MRI scans into different stages of Alzheimer's.

## 📘 Project Overview

The notebook (`Research_paper_implementation.ipynb`) replicates and extends ideas from a published research paper. It includes:

- Data preprocessing
- CNN architecture design
- Training and validation
- Evaluation metrics
- Visualization of results

## 🔗 Open in Google Colab

Run the notebook directly in Google Colab:

## 🧪 Dataset

- The dataset used typically includes **MRI images of the brain** categorized by stage:
  - Non-Demented
  - Very Mild Demented
  - Mild Demented
  - Moderate Demented
- Data may be sourced from **Kaggle** or other medical imaging datasets.
- Make sure to upload or link your dataset when running the notebook.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Model Evaluation

- Accuracy and loss graphs
- Confusion matrix
- Sample predictions
- Classification report
